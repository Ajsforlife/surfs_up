# SURFS UP Analysis
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to find tempuratures from a specific SQLite file and determine the tempuratures for the months of June and December.
### The Process
Queries are created to search through the data for the specific months of June and December and the data is then put into lists and then into dataframes and then summaries are performed

## Results
### Four Differences Between June and December
 -The first difference that was noticed is there are approximately 200 less temperatures recorded for december which is strange considering December is technically a longer month then June by 1 day.

-The second difference noticed was that June temperatures typically averaged higher then Decembers temperatures by approximately 4 degrees.

-The third difference noticed was the IQR for december is slightly larger for December which has an IQR of 5 and Junme has an IQR of 4

-The Fourth difference noticed was the standard deviation for June is lower then Decembers. The Min for December is Lower then Junes Min and the Max for June as suspected is higher then Decembers.
## Summary
### Data Review
This analysis was relatively straight forward, obviously Hawaii is a very warm state, but the data also showed that it is warmer in June then it is in December. Just like most of the United States. Howevery if you prefer to visit the tropical paradise and like cooler temperatures then December would be the time to go since the average temperature is lower then that of June. Though I do think the data might be slightly different if there were equal results for each month, this summary shows the basic information that you would want. The more data points provided will give a more realistic summary of data then less data points. Hawaii proves to be a warm state being warm most of the year even in December.
